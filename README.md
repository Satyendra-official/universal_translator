# 🌍 Universal Translator

Universal Translator is a Python-based app that can take **text, audio, or video** as input, translate it into a preferred language, and return the result as **text, speech, or even a video** with replaced or subtitled audio.

> 🚀 This is the CLI version — a web-based frontend will be added soon!
